                <br><br>
                <p>Ceylon Black tea is the most oxidized variety and contains more caffeine than the rest of the varieties. Black tea is best grown in a climate that is hot and moist where the temperature does not exceed 95 degrees Fahrenheit and does not fall below 55 degrees Fahrenheit. As a result of being close to the equator the climatic conditions of Sri Lanka is ideal to grow and produce Black tea. Tea is grown in numerous estates around the country which vary in altitude thus giving it distinctive qualities. High grown tea has a honey golden liquor that is light and considered to be one of the best tasting teas around the world due to its well-defined flavor, aroma and strength. Low grown tea has a burgundy brown liquor and a flavor which is rather strong. Mid grown teas have a strong, rich and full-bodied flavor.</p>

                <p>Ceylon white is also produced from the same plant as the black and green tea, though the plant has slight differences to it. The leaves and buds are left to wither in natural sunlight and there after they are lightly processed to avoid oxidization, this results in white tea being the least processed tea of all and is abundant with health benefits. Ceylon white is is famously known as ‘Silver Tips’, this is due to the color it transforms into after the manufacturing process, it is also one of the most priced teas in Sri Lanka. The tea was first grown in Nuwera-Eliya. Ceylon White tea is famous among tea lovers for its mild and sweet flavor, it has a delicate, very light liquoring with notes of pine and honey and a golden coppery infusion.</p>
