        <h2>THE HISTORY OF CEYLON TEA</h2>
        <br>
    <img src="../Images/img(11).webp" class="teaImg" alt="Tea Factory in Nuwara Eliya">
    <br><br>
        <p>Ever since James Taylor first introduced Ceylon Tea to the Global market in 1873, the Island's Tea industry was seeing exponential growths. The rapid increase in demand and popularity for the Island's Tea lead to it being sold at several auctions around the World, the first of which was held during the month of July in 1883 at Somerville & Co. in London, England. The tea later fetched sales figures of over one million units in the Chigago Fair of 1883.</p>
        <br>
        <p>By the 1960’s the total production of tea and exports of the Island exceeded 200,000 metric tonnes and over 200,000 hectares of the Island's land was allocated for the cultivation of tea, In the year 1965, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) became the world’s largest exporter of tea. In 1963 the production and export of instant Tea was introduced and the first International Tea Convention was held in 1966 to commemorate 100 years of tea industry in Sri Lanka. In 1976 the Sri Lankan Tea Board was founded along with others such as the Janatha Estate Development Board, Sri Lanka Estate Plantation Cooperation and the Tea Small Holding Development Authority, these bodies played a major part when it came to supervising the estates acquired by the state. And this same year tea bags were introduced to export.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Ceylon Tea is famous worldwide, the weather conditions in the Island provides vastly to the success of its growth. The  uniqueness of the Tea lies in its taste and quality that only the soils of Ceylon has managed to provide. The Island now caters Ceylon Tea to a several global markets and has become one the most sought after beverages worldwide.</p>

        <h2>REASON AS TO WHY PEOPLE DRINK TEA</h2>
        <br>
    <img src="../Images/img(22).webp" class="teaImg" alt="Enjoying Tea while Camping">
    <br><br>
        <p>As aforementioned, tea has taken the world by storm. Listed below are a few reasons as to why tea rose to its fame and is now commemorated as the most popular beverage next to water.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="space">Tea helps in shedding belly fat - Tea is a proven metabolism booster and given that so much about your weight is predicated on your metabolic rate, it is revered for its ability to oxidize fat by up to 17% and improve overall weight loss by up to 77%.</li>
            <li class="space">Improves dental health - Drinking green tea, you’ll also be proactively decreasing the formation of plaque in your mouth, in addition to combatting cavities and tooth decay.</li>
            <li class="space">Tea is rich with tons of antioxidants - Black and green teas contain chemicals called flavonoids that prevent oxidation and also decrease clotting in the body. Green tea will have the most abundant amount of antioxidants because it is not fermented, whereas the black variety is.</li>
            <li class="space">Helps battle Alzheimer's and Dementia - A study conducted by Rushworth concludes that a naturally occuring component of green tea aids in curing Alzheimer's disease.</li>
            <li class="space">A good way to wake up in the morning - While many people believe that coffee is the is the best source of caffine in the morning real world numbers suggest otherwise. A standard cup of mild-roast coffee will contain around 150 mg of caffeine in each 8 oz. cup. While green tea – which has more caffeine than standard tea – has about 30 mg of caffeine per 8 oz. serving.</li>

    <br><br><br>
        <h3>STEPS</h3>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li class="space">For best results, boil freshly drawn filtered or spring water to the boil. Ensure you never use mineral water.</li>
            <li class="space">Preheat your tea vessel with boiling water, and then discard the water. You could do this by pouring some boiling water into a teapot, and then pour water from the teapot to your teacups, and then discard this water.</li>
            <li class="space">Carefully measure your tea leaves, as we recommend using 1 teaspoon of loose tea to every 200 to 250 ml of water. If brewed in a teapot, the golden rule is one teaspoon for you and one for the pot!</li>
            <li class="space">Place your tea leaves in the teapot and then pour your water directly over the tea leaves. Close the lid.</li>            
            <li class="space">After 2 minutes, open the lid and stir the tea leaves well so that they will have the optimum chance of brewing in the water. Close the lid.</li>
            <li class="space">Steep the leaves for a further 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li class="space">Once you have steeped the leaves, place a strainer over the teacup and pour the tea to prevent any tea leaves from going into the cup. Do not leave the tea pot on a fire or a cooker.</li>
            <li class="space">Once the full volume of brewed tea is served into cups, do the same process again if you wish to drink more cups as reusing already brewed tea leaves will not give you the same flavor and experience that is expected from a true cup of black tea.</li>
            <li class="space">Serve and Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
